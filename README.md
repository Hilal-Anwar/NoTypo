# NoTypo

NoTypo is a tool designed to streamline the process of creating educational coding videos. By automating code writing and providing real-time code simulation, NoTypo allows content creators to focus on delivering clear and engaging explanations, enhancing the educational value of their videos.

## Motivation

While making a video on a 1000-line project, I became frustrated with the time-consuming process of documenting and demonstrating the code. This experience highlighted the inefficiencies of balancing coding and explanations, motivating me to create NoTypo to reduce this complexity.

## Features

- **Automated Code Writing**: Automatically generates code, saving creators from manual coding during demonstrations.
- **Simplified Video Creation**: Reduces the complexity of creating educational videos, making the process more efficient.
- **Enhanced Explanations**: Allows creators to focus on delivering clear and engaging explanations, improving the educational value of their videos.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Integrates seamlessly into the content creation process, helping creators manage their time and resources more effectively.
- **Improved Video Quality**: Leads to higher instructional quality and a better viewing experience for the audience.
- **Customization Options**: Offers various customization options to tailor the automated code to specific needs and preferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with an intuitive interface that makes it easy for creators to use the tool without a steep learning curve.
- **Real-Time Code Simulation**: Provides real-time simulation of code writing, allowing creators to demonstrate coding concepts dynamically.

## Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

NoTypo stands out by specifically targeting content creators, particularly those making educational videos. Unlike general coding assistants, NoTypo automates the code writing process for video demonstrations, saving creators significant time and effort. The planned integration of Gemini support will further enhance the tool by explaining the entire project and determining the optimal order for code writing.

## Future Development

We plan to add Gemini support, which will help in explaining the entire project and deciding the order in which the code should be written. This enhancement aims to transform NoTypo into a comprehensive solution for video documenting any given project, further streamlining the content creation process and improving the instructional quality of educational videos.
